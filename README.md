### Backend Services

#### Firebase Integration
- Authentication
- Real-time Database
- Cloud Functions
- Storage
- Analytics

#### Express.js Backend
- RESTful API endpoints
- Business logic
- Data validation
- Service integration

## Technical Implementation

### Authentication Flow
1. User opens app
2. Google Sign-In prompt
3. Firebase authentication
4. JWT token generation
5. Secure session management

### Data Flow
```
User Input → Frontend Validation → API Request → Backend Processing → Database Operation → Response → UI Update
```

### Security Measures
- JWT authentication
- Rate limiting
- Data encryption
- Input sanitization
- Regular security audits
